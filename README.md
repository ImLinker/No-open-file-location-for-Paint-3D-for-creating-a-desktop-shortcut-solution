Step by step text only:

If you're like me and wanting a desktop shortcut for Paint3D or another Windows11 application, you may run into a problem from your traditional way of creating a desktop shortcut of going to start menu, searching for the application, right clicking and opening the file location to create a shortcut. With UWP apps, or Universal Windows Platform applications you will not find the "Open file location" when right clicking and it will be missing from the list of options even with a shift right click on the application.
Here is the solution:
1) Open File Explorer or press WinKey + E to open File Explore
2) In the search / address bar, type shell:AppsFolder
3)  Find Paint3D or whichever application you want to create a shortcut for
4) Right click Paint3D and select "Create shortcut"
5) A popup stating a shortcut can't be created in the current location but asks if you want one created on the desktop instead, select yes
6) Navigate to your desktop and verify the shortcut has been created
